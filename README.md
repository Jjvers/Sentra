# Sentra - AI Election Chatbot 🗳️

**Sentra** is an advanced RAG-based (Retrieval Augmented Generation) chatbot designed to answer questions about the Indonesian Election 2024 using trusted news sources (The Jakarta Post, Tempo, ANTARA, Jakarta Globe).

What sets Sentra apart is its **Dual-Model Evaluation System** which compares its own AI judgments (Model A) against baseline heuristics (Model B) in real-time.

## 🚀 Key Features

### 1. RAG-Based Knowledge
Answers are grounded in a curated database of 100+ news articles, minimizing hallucinations.

### 2. A/B Model Comparison System
Sentra doesn't just answer; it evaluates itself using two competing approaches for every response:

| Component | Model A (Machine Learning) 🧠 | Model B (Baseline) 📊 |
|:---|:---|:---|
| **Hallucination** | **Logistic Regression** (Trained on semantic features) | **Keyword Overlap** (Simple heuristic) |
| **Confidence** | **Random Forest** (Trained on retrieval metrics) | **Chunk Count** (Quantity heuristic) |
| **Framing** | **TF-IDF + NER** (Statistical significance) | **Word Count** (Frequency baseline) |

### 3. Real-Time Analytics Dashboard
The frontend displays a live comparison of how Model A and Model B evaluate the current answer, showing verify/unverified claims side-by-side.
