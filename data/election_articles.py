During a visit to schools in Aceh, Prabowo noted that over 1 million students in the province are benefiting from the nutritious meals program despite the region voting overwhelmingly for other candidates. The statement underscores Prabowo's effort to present himself as a president for all Indonesians, not just those who supported his campaign.

The roadmap will outline strategies for electrifying public transportation, promoting electric vehicles, improving fuel efficiency standards, and developing sustainable aviation and maritime fuels. Transportation is one of Indonesia's fastest-growing sources of carbon emissions due to increasing vehicle ownership and freight movement in the rapidly urbanizing nation. The roadmap development involves coordination with the energy ministry, environmental agencies, and private sector stakeholders to ensure realistic and economically viable pathways to low-carbon mobility.",

Indonesia has engaged with multiple suppliers including the United States (F-35), France (Rafale), and participation in Turkey's TF-X program, seeking cutting-edge air superiority capabilities to match regional powers. Critics argue that the focus on expensive prestige platforms diverts resources from more pressing defense needs including maritime surveillance, cyber capabilities, and conventional force modernization. The analysis weighs Indonesia's legitimate security concerns in a contested South China Sea environment against fiscal constraints and the historical pattern of ambitious defense procurement programs that have stalled due to funding shortfalls.",

Researchers documented recruitment efforts using gaming platforms, encrypted messaging apps, and social media algorithms that expose children to gradually escalating radical content. The investigation found that extremist narratives often exploit legitimate grievances about social injustice, economic inequality, or perceived attacks on religious identity to radicalize young users. Experts recommend a multi-stakeholder approach involving platforms, educators, parents, and government to build digital literacy and resilience against extremist messaging among Indonesia's digitally connected youth population.",

Environmental and consumer advocates have pushed back, arguing that thrift culture promotes sustainability and provides affordable clothing options for low-income consumers.
